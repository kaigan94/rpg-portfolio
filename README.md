# 🧙‍♂️ My RPG Portfolio

A magical retro-inspired developer portfolio — built with **React** and styled with custom **pixel art UI**.  
This is my **first project in React**, and it’s been both a challenge and a passion project!

## ✨ Features

- 🎮 RPG-style UI with pixel borders and fantasy elements
- ⚔️ About, Projects and Contact sections with unique styling
- 📱 Fully responsive layout for mobile, tablet and desktop
- 🔧 Custom tooltips, pixel fonts and animated UI details

## 📐 Tech Stack

- **React** (Vite)
- **CSS** with custom pixel styles
- Responsive design with **media queries**
- Image rendering optimised for pixel art

## 🚧 Ongoing Development

This is just the beginning!  
I plan to:

- Add animation and transitions to enhance immersion
- Improve mobile UX and spacing on more devices
- Create custom pixel icons and background assets
- Build a backend for project data and character creation (possibly Spring Boot)

## 📬 Contact

Feel free to reach out via the contact section!  
I'm currently looking for internship opportunities and junior frontend roles.
